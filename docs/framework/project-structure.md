# Project Structure

## TL;DR

NoodleCrew organizes files into **three layers**: INPUT (your idea), STATE (crew internals), and OUTPUT (generated docs). The separation keeps your deliverables clean while the system manages its own complexity.

```
my-project/
├── IDEA.md              # INPUT  — You write this
├── INDEX.md             # STATE  — Visible status summary
├── .noodlecrew/         # STATE  — Hidden internals
└── docs/                # OUTPUT — Clean deliverables
```

---

## Quick Reference

| I want to... | Look at |
|--------------|---------|
| Write my idea | `IDEA.md` |
| Check progress | `INDEX.md` |
| See generated artifacts | `docs/` |
| Configure the crew | `.noodlecrew/manifest.yml` |
| Answer a blocker question | `.noodlecrew/questions/` |
| Debug execution | `.noodlecrew/logs/` |

## The Three Layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Who Modifies |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **INPUT** | `IDEA.md` | Your idea | You |
| **STATE** | `INDEX.md` + `.noodlecrew/` | Crew status | Crew |
| **OUTPUT** | `docs/` | Deliverables | Crew |

### Why This Separation?

1. **INPUT is visible** — Your idea is the entry point, always at the root
2. **STATE is summarized** — `INDEX.md` shows status; details hidden in `.noodlecrew/`
3. **OUTPUT is clean** — `docs/` contains only deliverables, no system files

---

## Input Layer

### IDEA.md

Your idea — the entry point for the crew.

**Location:** Project root

**Minimal structure:**

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Problem
[What pain point are you solving?]

## Solution
[Your proposed approach]

## Users
[Who is this for?]
```

The crew reads this to understand what to build.

---

## State Layer

### INDEX.md (Visible Summary)

Human-readable status at a glance.

**Location:** Project root

```yaml
---
type: project
status: in_progress
current_phase: architecture
current_iteration: 42
cost_so_far: 8.47
---
```

```markdown
# My Project

## Status
- **Phase:** Architecture (2/3)
- **Progress:** 5/9 tasks complete
- **Iteration:** 42/100

## Recent Activity
- [x] docs/discovery/prd.md
- [x] docs/discovery/personas.md
- [ ] docs/architecture/adrs/001-frontend.md (in progress)
```

### .noodlecrew/ (Hidden Internals)

All crew configuration and detailed state.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `manifest.yml` | Crew configuration |
| `tasks.md` | Detailed task backlog |
| `experts/` | Expert definitions |
| `phases/` | Phase definitions |
| `questions/` | Blocker questions |
| `logs/` | Execution history |

### .noodlecrew/tasks.md

Task backlog the crew reads to know what to do next:

```markdown
## Discovery Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Generate PRD from IDEA.md
- [x] Define user personas

## Architecture Phase 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [x] ADR-001: Frontend framework
- [ ] ADR-002: Database choice
- [ ] ADR-003: Authentication

## Implementation Phase ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Generate CHANGELOG
- [ ] Document implementation steps
```

### .noodlecrew/questions/

Blocker questions requiring your input:

```markdown
---
from: software-architect
type: blocker
status: pending
---

# BLOCKER: Authentication Strategy

## Question
Should we support SAML, OIDC, or both?

## Your Answer
**Decision:** ___
```

When you answer and run `ncrew resume`, execution continues.

---

## Output Layer

### docs/

All generated artifacts. Clean and deliverable.

```
docs/
├── discovery/              # Product Owner outputs
│   ├── prd.md              # Product Requirements
│   ├── personas.md         # User personas
│   └── vision.md           # Product vision
├── architecture/           # Architect outputs
│   ├── adrs/               # Decision Records
│   └── architecture.md     # System overview
└── implementation/         # Developer outputs
    ├── changelog.md        # Product changelog
    └── implementation-notes.md
```

**Note:** `docs/implementation/changelog.md` is the changelog of *the product being built*, not the crew execution log.

## File Ownership Summary

| File | Created By | Modified By | Visibility |
|------|------------|-------------|------------|
| `IDEA.md` | You | You | Visible |
| `INDEX.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew | Visible |
| `.noodlecrew/manifest.yml` | `ncrew init` | You | Hidden |
| `.noodlecrew/tasks.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew | Hidden |
| `.noodlecrew/questions/` | Crew | You (answers) | Hidden |
| `docs/*` | Crew | Crew | Visible |

---

## Marketplace Crews

When you install a marketplace crew:

```bash
ncrew init my-project --crew saas-b2b
```

The crew package is **copied** to your project:

```
marketplace/saas-b2b/  →  .noodlecrew/
├── manifest.yml           ├── manifest.yml
├── experts/               ├── experts/
└── phases/                └── phases/
```

You own the copy. Customize freely.

---

## Git Integration

Every iteration creates a commit:

```
feat(discovery): generate PRD
feat(discovery): define user personas
feat(architecture): ADR-001 frontend stack
```

Full audit trail in git history.
