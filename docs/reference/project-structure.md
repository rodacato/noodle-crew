## Directory Numbering Convention

Directories are numbered to indicate execution order:

| 00 | Input | User |
| 01 | Discovery | Product Owner |
| 02 | Planning | Product Manager (future) |
| 03 | Design | UX Designer (future) |

## Git Integration

Every iteration creates a git commit:

feat(architecture): ADR-001 frontend stack (iteration 3)
...
```

**Commit format:** `feat(<phase>): <task description> (iteration <n>)`

**Tags:** Created at phase completion (e.g., `v0.1.0-discovery-complete`)
