## Directory Structure Rationale

The structure follows these principles:

| Location | Visibility | Rationale |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `IDEA.md` | Visible (root) | Entry point should be obvious |
| `INDEX.md`, `TODO.md` | Visible (root) | State tracking should be accessible |
| `docs/` | Visible (root) | Standard documentation location |
| `questions/` | Visible (root) | Blockers need user attention |
| `.noodlecrew/` | Hidden | Configuration is internal |
| `.noodlecrew/logs/` | Hidden | Debug info is internal |

---

## File Ownership

| File/Directory | Created By | Modified By |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `.noodlecrew/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/manifest.yml` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/experts/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/phases/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/logs/` | Crew | — |
| `IDEA.md` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `INDEX.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew |
| `TODO.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew |
| `docs/discovery/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `docs/architecture/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `docs/implementation/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `questions/*` | Crew | User (answers) |

---

## Git Integration

Every iteration creates a git commit:

```
feat(discovery): generate PRD (iteration 1)
feat(discovery): define user personas (iteration 2)
feat(architecture): ADR-001 frontend stack (iteration 3)
...
```

**Commit format:** `feat(<phase>): <task description> (iteration <n>)`

**Tags:** Created at phase completion (e.g., `v0.1.0-discovery-complete`)
