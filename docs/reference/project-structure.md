## Overview

When you run `ncrew init <project-name>`, NoodleCrew creates a structured project folder designed for autonomous execution and human auditability.

**Created by:** `ncrew init`

**Modified by:** User (manual editing)

```text
.noodlecrew/
├── manifest.yml                      # Crew manifest

    └── discovery/PHASE.md
```

### manifest.yml

**Purpose:** Crew manifest — declares experts, LLM settings, phases, gates.

See [Configuration Guide](../guides/index.md) for all options.

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-project"
  type: "saas"

crew:
  default_llm: claude
  experts:
    - role: product-owner
    - role: software-architect

---

# My Crew

Description of what this crew does.
```

### PHASES.md

**Purpose:** Phases overview and execution flow.

```markdown
# Phases

## Flow

1. **Discovery** — Product Owner creates PRD
2. **Architecture** — Architect makes technical decisions
3. **Implementation** — Developer creates specs
```

### INDEX.md

**Purpose:** Master state document — tracks progress, current phase, artifacts generated.

**Created by:** `ncrew init`

**Modified by:** Crew (automatically during execution)

**Example:**

```markdown
---
type: project
status: in_progress
current_phase: architecture
current_iteration: 42
cost_so_far: 8.47
created: "2026-01-28"
updated: "2026-01-28T14:52:33Z"
---

```

### TODO.md

**Purpose:** Task backlog — tracks pending, in-progress, and completed tasks per phase.

**Created by:** `ncrew init`

**Modified by:** Expert (marks tasks complete during execution)

See [State Files](state-files.md#todomd) for complete format and phase status rules.

---

## Input: IDEA.md

**Purpose:** Your idea — the entry point for the crew.

**Location:** Project root (visible!)

**Created by:** `ncrew init`

**Modified by:** User

**Minimal structure:**

## Users
[Who is this for?]
```

**Phase:** Architecture

**Expert:** Software Architect

**Structure:**

```text
docs/architecture/
├── adrs/                         # Architecture Decision Records

```

---

## Questions Directory

### questions/

**Purpose:** Blocker questions requiring human input. Visible at project root because they need your attention.

**Structure:**

```text
questions/
├── architect-001-auth.md         # Question about authentication
└── developer-002-deployment.md   # Question about deployment
```

**Resolved by:** User (answering in the file, then `ncrew resume`)

See [State Files](state-files.md#questions-blockers) for blocker format and lifecycle.

---

## Logs Directory

### .noodlecrew/logs/

**Purpose:** Execution logs for debugging and auditing. Hidden inside `.noodlecrew/` because they're internal.

**Files:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log`

**Example:**

```text
.noodlecrew/logs/
├── 2026-01-28-143522.log         # Execution started at 14:35:22
└── 2026-01-28-161245.log         # Resumed at 16:12:45
```

**Log Format:**

```text

```

## Directory Structure Rationale

The structure follows these principles:

| Location | Visibility | Rationale |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `IDEA.md` | Visible (root) | Entry point should be obvious |
| `INDEX.md`, `TODO.md` | Visible (root) | State tracking should be accessible |
| `docs/` | Visible (root) | Standard documentation location |
| `questions/` | Visible (root) | Blockers need user attention |
| `.noodlecrew/` | Hidden | Configuration is internal |
| `.noodlecrew/logs/` | Hidden | Debug info is internal |

---

## File Ownership

| File/Directory | Created By | Modified By |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `.noodlecrew/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/manifest.yml` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/experts/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/phases/` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `.noodlecrew/logs/` | Crew | — |
| `IDEA.md` | `ncrew init` | User |
| `INDEX.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew |
| `TODO.md` | `ncrew init` | Crew |
| `docs/discovery/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `docs/architecture/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `docs/implementation/*` | Crew | Crew |
| `questions/*` | Crew | User (answers) |

---

## Git Integration

Every iteration creates a git commit:

```
feat(discovery): generate PRD (iteration 1)
feat(discovery): define user personas (iteration 2)
feat(architecture): ADR-001 frontend stack (iteration 3)
...
```

**Commit format:** `feat(<phase>): <task description> (iteration <n>)`

**Tags:** Created at phase completion (e.g., `v0.1.0-discovery-complete`)
