# Personal Finance Tracker

## Problem

I want to know where my money goes each month, but:
- Banking apps are overcomplicated with features I don't need
- Spreadsheets are ugly and require manual maintenance
- I forget to track expenses and lose visibility

I need something dead simple: open app, log expense, see where I'm at.

## Solution

A minimal web app for personal expense tracking:

1. **Quick expense entry** — Amount, category, optional note. Done in 3 taps.
2. **Visual categories** — Color-coded (food=green, transport=blue, etc). Instant recognition.
3. **Monthly dashboard** — Pie chart of spending by category. "This month so far" total.
4. **No accounts, no sync** — Local storage only. Privacy first. Works offline.

## Target User

Solo developer or freelancer who:
- Earns variable income
- Wants awareness, not budgeting tools
- Values simplicity over features
- Would rather build than subscribe to Mint/YNAB

## Success Criteria

- Can log an expense in under 5 seconds
- Can see monthly breakdown at a glance
- Works on mobile browser (responsive)
- No backend required for MVP

## Out of Scope (for now)

- User accounts / authentication
- Cloud sync between devices
- Budget goals and alerts
- Recurring expenses
- Multiple currencies
- CSV import/export

## Inspiration

- [Toshl](https://toshl.com) — Simple UI but too many features
- [Spending Tracker](https://apps.apple.com) — Good mobile UX but iOS only
- Plain spreadsheet — Functional but not enjoyable
